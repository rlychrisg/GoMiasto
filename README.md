# GoMiasto

![ Two screenshots of the game, the first is of the UK, and the second is the USA. A silhouette of each country takes up roughly half of the screen, and below there is a table containing an imput box and previous guesses. Each guess shows the distance in miles and the compass direction pointing to the answer.](screenshot.png "Screenshot GoMiasto")

## How to Play

[Click here to play](https://rlychrisg.github.io/GoMiasto/)

Guess a city or location to win. You have only 6 attempts, but each incorrect guess will give you the distance and direction to help with your next guess. Distance is given 'as the crow flies' and the location of the pin drop will typically be the city centre. Only valid answers can be submitted but if you're unsure then suggestions will pop up once you start typing.

In the settings menu, players can choose to measure distance in either Miles or Km, as well as choose from four difficulty levels.

Want to play a location that isn't provided yet? Feel free to request or contribute your ideas on the Github page.

## Background
This started off as a project to teach myself Python, but when I got to the gui stage I found myself hitting too many walls that I couldn't find a way around. GoMiasto is heavily inspired by the web game [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/), and it started to occur to me that if my inspiration was a web game, then I'd probably have better luck if I tried to make a web game.

This game functions (and nobody can take that away from me!) but it is quite clearly the work of an amateur. I didn't want to put this out into the world until it met a standard I was happy with, but I think I've given it a good effort, and this is as far as I can take it without my head exploding. Any input whatsoever would be greatly appreciated, I will do my best to act on any issues or suggestions.
